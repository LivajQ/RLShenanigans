A bunch of questionable addons meant to work with RLCraft

Some of the most notable features of this mod:

- SRParasites mobs are now tameable using enchanted golden apples. Holding apples does not prevent aggression until fully tamed (intended)
- Tamed parasites can be managed and given commands like follow or ride with right click
- THH (Thigh Highed Horrors) textures for tamed parasites
- Ranged mobs can fire projectiles when ridden
- Parasites can talk like villagers, skeletons etc. when tamed
- Custom death messages for parasites
- New potion effects: 
	- Pookie - disables parasite aggression and makes them follow the player with the effect, also assisting them in combat. Affected parasites have no drops. Part of living/sentient armor set bonus
	- Stagger - makes affected entity unable to move or react
	- Bloodthirsty - increases damage, attack speed, grants lifesteal ability, and applies bleed to foes
- Parasite wands (allowing assimilation, evolution etc.) now obtainable when asking tamed parasites for drops, among some other custom items
- Lust pendant - gives sinful effect with multiple mobs around you (the more total hp the bigger the amplifier)
- Fixed heart - restores missing heart containers
- New weapon: Zweihander - low attack speed, high damage, applies stagger effect
- Custom mobs wielding special items
- Lycanite bosses drop eggs/soulstones spawning tamed variants
- Minibosses (lunar grue etc.) can be tamed
- More lycanite mobs are now tameable/rideable, each with their own special ability
- Elemental treat and saddle are now craftable
- Pets can be summoned in the Lost Cities
- Whitelist for non-parasites and non-lycanites in the config, allowing virtually every mob to be tameable
- Pocket pet holder for easy pet storage and transportation
- Bad armor debuffs >:(
- Music disc backport
- New structures added to random gen
- Wormhole potions can be brewed into recalls
- Vampirism rework - each hit has a chance to apply the Bloodthirsty effect. The effect can stack depending on the enchantment level
- Dr. Jr.
