A bunch of questionable addons meant to work with RLCraft

Some of the most notable features of this mod:

-SRParasites mobs are now tameable using enchanted golden apples. Holding apples does not prevent aggression until fully tamed (intended)

-Tamed parasites can be managed and given commands like follow or ride with right click

-THH (Thigh Highed Horrors) textures for tamed parasites

-Ranged mobs can fire projectiles when ridden

-New potion effect: Pookie - disables parasite aggression and makes them follow the player with the effect, also assisting them in combat. Affected parasites have no drops. Part of sentient armor set bonus (TBA [maybe craftable soon])

-Parasite wands (allowing assimilation, evolution etc.) now obtainable when asking tamed parasites for drops, among some other custom items
